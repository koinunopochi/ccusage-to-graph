## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed
- Fixed bar length calculation using Math.ceil() to ensure values just above thresholds display correctly
- Fixed threshold marker positions using Math.floor() for more accurate placement
- Fixed issue where $22 appeared as only 2 characters instead of 3 in $500 scale

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-04

### Changed
- Completely redesigned threshold display system
- Scale now uses fixed increments ($50, $100, $200, $500) for clearer visualization
- Threshold markers appear as subtle lines in the empty space after bars
- Removed overlapping threshold lines on bars for cleaner look

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where bars exceeding thresholds appeared before threshold markers
- Fixed scale calculation to ensure threshold positions are always accurate

### Added
- Scale information in legend showing the current scale range

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed
- Fixed threshold line visibility - now shows on top of bars when they overlap
- Threshold lines use different characters when overlapping with bars (â”ƒ) vs empty space (â”‚)

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed
- Fixed date formatting to use consistent MM/DD format
- Fixed bar chart alignment issues when date strings have different lengths
